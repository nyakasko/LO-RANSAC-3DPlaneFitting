# LO-RANSAC 3DPlaneFitting
 
 
The project is an implementation of the Locally Optimized RANSAC Random SAmple Consensus (LO-RANSAC) 3D plane fitting algorithm. 

Input is a 3D pointcloud.

The outputs are (1) the same pointcloud where the inliers of the model are shown with a different color
and (2) the coeffficients of the found plane's model.
